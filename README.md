Data Analysist:	Preston Stoltzfus

Problem: Not enough engaging social media posts
	
Goal: Using patient data of the active pets, find out the most popular names, species, and breeds of cats/dogs.

Privacy: Names of clients have been removed from the dataset. 

Data: The hospital uses a program called "cornerstone" (which is made by a company called "Idexx") which keeps all the data that will be used for this project. Data includes all active patients in the hospital as of June 2023

Stakeholders: Office manager & social media cordinator. 

Deliverable: Csv or excel file of top 10 list of most popular names, species, and breeds (of cats/dogs). Althought not this departments responsibility, an artist will then use this information to make a hand drawn graphic(s) showing the info.
